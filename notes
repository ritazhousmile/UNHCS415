Python Basics 

Output is done by using print()
Input is done by using input()





python casting: 
int()
float()
str()

order of operations:
      PEMDAS
      parentheses(highest precedence)
      Exponentiation
      Multiplication &Division
      Addition & substraction
operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right

Multiline strings: you can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
  a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
        consectetur adipiscing elit,
        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
        ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

print(a)
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Escape sequences are special character combinations that allow us to represent characters that are hard/impossible to include directly in a string.


      Some popular sequences:
      \t: Tab Character
      \n: Newline character (moves text after it to the next line)
      \': Lets us represent single quotes in a string
      \": Lets us represent double quotes in a string
      \\: Lets us represent slashes in a string
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

Slicing Strings: You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
  
    b = "Hello, World!"
      print(b[2:5]) llo
Slicing to the end: By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end
  	b = "Hello, World!"
  print(b[2:]) llo, World!

Modifying Strings : upper() 
The replace() method replaces a string with another string

  a = "Hello, World!"
    print(a.replace("H", "J")) Jello, World!

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator. To add a space between them, add a " "
